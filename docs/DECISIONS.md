# Decisions

Methodological and implementation choices that are not fully determined by
`docs/EXPERIMENT.md`, with the reason for each. Change an entry here before
changing the behaviour it describes.

## 2026-09-07 — Initial pipeline implementation

### D1. Prompt format and target tokenisation

`Q: {input}\nA:` for the query, ` {output}` for the target, demonstrations
separated by a blank line. The prompt and the target are tokenised
*separately* (the target with a leading space and without special tokens) and
the token ids are concatenated, so that the target tokenisation is identical
across few-shot, zero-shot, steered and unsteered conditions. This is the
tokenisation that the `max_target_tokens` item filter sees. All template
strings are config parameters (`prompt.*`).

### D2. Decision metric and the teacher-forced pass

All behavioural metrics come from one teacher-forced pass over
`prompt + target`. Logits are computed only at the target positions (the
final-norm hidden states are gathered before the unembedding), which keeps
memory small for a 152k vocabulary. Exact match requires the argmax at *every*
target position to equal the target token.

### D3. Extraction reads every layer in one pass; candidates by depth fraction

Residuals at the final query token are gathered at all `L+1` read points in a
single forward pass per prompt, so extraction at every candidate layer costs
one pass per (seed, pair). Candidate layers are
`round(fraction * L)` for the configured depth fractions (default 20–60%),
deduplicated. For Qwen3-0.6B (`L = 28`) this gives layers 6, 8, 11, 14, 17.
Stability at *every* read point is also written (exploratory diagnostic).

### D4. Stability gate filters candidate layers before calibration

"Require cross-seed direction stability at the candidate layer" is implemented
as: only candidate layers whose minimum pairwise `|cos|` across seed PC1s is
`>= qualification.min_stability` (default 0.8) enter calibration. If none
passes, the task is rejected at the stability stage. Rationale: calibration
on an unstable direction would be selecting an artefact of one demonstration
sample.

### D5. Calibration selection rule, operationalised

At each stable layer (ascending) and each grid strength (ascending) the real
direction is scored on the calibration pool. A point is *reliable* if

1. one-sided paired bootstrap `p <= calibration.bootstrap_alpha` (0.05) for
   mean Δ(log p per target token) > 0 (with +1 continuity correction);
2. mean Δ `>= calibration.min_improvement` (0.05 nats/token);
3. its mean Δ exceeds the mean Δ of `n_random_screen` (8) matched random
   directions (same layer, same absolute norm; alternating isotropic and
   orthogonal) with empirical `p_upper <= random_screen_max_p` (0.2). With 8
   controls the minimum attainable p is 1/9 ≈ 0.11, so the real direction
   must beat all eight.

The selected point is the first reliable point in this order (earliest layer,
then smallest strength). The random screen is only run at points that pass
(1)–(2) while the layer can still be, or is, the selected layer; the full real
grid is still computed for every stable layer for the calibration figure.

Grid extension: after a layer's grid is exhausted, if the best point (max mean
Δ) sits at the upper edge the next strength `rho * extension_factor` (1.25) is
appended, up to `max_rho` (2.0). Extended points are flagged in the output.

### D6. Held-out qualification thresholds

On the evaluation pool: paired bootstrap `p <= qualification.steering_alpha`
(0.05) and mean Δ > 0; and empirical `p_upper <= random_control_max_p` (0.1)
against the 16 matched random controls (minimum attainable 1/17 ≈ 0.059, so the
real direction must beat all 16). Thresholds are configuration parameters.

### D7. Per-example quantities are undefined below the intervention layer

`δ_l = 0` exactly for `l < l*` (the two passes are bit-identical up to the
intervention; the pipeline records the maximum |δ| below `l*` as a check). All
per-example and matrix metrics are reported as null there, and `d_eff`, `d90`
and the centred `N_l` are null *at* `l*` as specified. The observed centred
spectrum at `l*` is stored separately as the numerical-noise-floor diagnostic.

### D8. Conversion mass and profile labels

The cross-task analysis defines the conversion mass of block `l` as the median
over held-out examples of `||b_l(x)||`, normalised over downstream blocks. From
it: entropy ratio, dominant block and share, centre of mass in normalised
depth, and early-conversion share. Qualitative labels are assigned by fixed
rules with thresholds in `analysis.*` (see `src/directions/analysis.py`);
several labels can co-occur and the rules are deliberately simple. They are a
summary of the quantities, not a replacement for them.

### D9. Random controls in the layerwise stage reuse the steering-stage passes

The 16 matched random controls used for the held-out behavioural test are the
same forward passes (with residual capture) used for the random-control null
of every layerwise metric. The real direction's z and empirical p are
computed per layer against these 16 profiles.

### D10. Block ablation (exploratory)

Blocks are chosen by the largest median conversion `C_l` (or, by config, the
largest uncentred `N_l`). Necessity subtracts the per-example `b_l(x)` at
`resid[l+1]` inside the steered run; sufficiency adds it to an unsteered run.
Both use the per-example vectors captured in the layerwise stage. Fractions
lost/reproduced are relative to the mean steering improvement on the decision
metric. Written to `exploratory/`.

### D11. Smoke mode (`qualification.enforce: false`)

The integration path uses a tiny random model that does no task. To exercise
every stage, gates are computed and logged but do not block; when calibration
finds no reliable point the best grid point is used and flagged
`fallback: true`. Smoke runs are never scientific results. Real configs set
`enforce: true`.

### D12. Reproducibility

All sub-seeds derive from `seed` through SHA-256 (`seeds.py`); the seed table
is written to `metadata.json`. `directions compare <run_a> <run_b>` diffs every
JSON output of two runs ignoring only run id, timestamps, timings and argv.
Proven for the toy path in `tests/test_integration.py`; see `STATUS.md` for the
GPU runs.

### D13. Which blocks the causal ablation targets

"Layers with unusually large conversion or new-subspace creation" is
ambiguous between *largest value* and *largest relative to the random-control
null*. `exploratory.block_ablation.rank_by` selects: `value` (default, the
preregistered pilot configs) ranks blocks by the median metric itself, which
in practice always includes the intervention block (its `C_l` is largest
because `δ_{l*}` is the pure injected direction); `z` ranks by the per-block
z-score against the matched random controls. The ablation is exploratory, so
both are available and the choice is recorded in `block_ablation.json`.
